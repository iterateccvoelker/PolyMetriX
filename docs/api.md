# PolyMetriX
PolyMetriX is a Python package designed for getting the polymer related featurizers that can be used for downstream tasks. The functionality of this package is that deals with the rdkit mol objects to get desired featurizers on full, sidechain and backbone polymer level. In addition, you can also download the curated dataset for glass transition temperature (Tg) data for the polymers using this package.

# Citing PolyMetriX
We are currently in the process of writing a paper on PolyMetrix - we will update the citatiobn information here once the paper is published.
