The `Polymer` class in `PolyMetriX` is designed to distinguish between the backbone and side chains of a polymer. It identifies which atoms in a polymer belong to the backbone and which belong to the side chains. 

This is achieved by converting the `PSMILES` representation into a graph-based representation using the `NetworkX` library. By utilizing graph theory concepts such as `shortest path`, `cycles`, `connected components`, and the `degree` of nodes, the `Polymer` class classifies the backbone and side chain atoms within a polymer.

## Graph Theory Concepts
1. **Nodes and Edges**: In the context of a polymer, nodes represent atoms and edges represent bonds between atoms.
2. **Shortest Path**: The shortest path between two nodes is the smallest number of edges that must be traversed to reach one node from the other.
3. **Cycles**: A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node, forming a closed loop.
4. **Connected Components**: A connected component is a subgraph in which every node is reachable from every other node.
5. **Degree of a Node**: The degree of a node is the number of edges incident to that node.

## Distinguishing Backbone and Side Chains
The process of classifying nodes into backbone and side chain components is handled by the `classify_backbone_and_sidechains` helper function in the `Polymer` class. This function uses the following steps to identify the backbone and side chain atoms:

1. **Graph Construction**: The `PSMILES` representation of the polymer is converted into a graph using the `NetworkX` library. Special "asterisk" atoms (*) in the `PSMILES` notation represent connection points, often indicating the ends or repeating units of the polymer.

2. **Shortest Paths Between Connection Points**: The algorithm identifies all shortest paths between pairs of asterisk (*) nodes. These paths often correspond to the main chain or repeating units of the polymer, forming the initial backbone.

3. **Cycles Detection**: Cycles (closed loops) in the graph that include nodes from these shortest paths are identified. In polymers, cycles can represent repeating units or cyclic structures within the backbone. Nodes in these cycles are added to the backbone.

4. **Degree-1 Nodes**: Nodes with a degree of 1 (connected to only one other node) that are attached to the backbone are also included in the backbone. These are typically terminal groups or atoms at the ends of the chain.

5. **Connected Components**: The remaining nodes in the graph that are not part of the backbone are considered side chain atoms. These atoms are connected to the backbone but are not part of the main chain.

By following these steps, the `Polymer` class can accurately distinguish between the backbone and side chain atoms of a polymer.

## Step-by-Step Example
Letâ€™s walk through an example using a simple polymer, Poly(isobutyl acrylate) represented by the following `PSMILES` notation:

```
PSMILES: [*]CC(C(OCC(C)C)=O)[*]
```

Step 1: Initialize the Polymer
```python
from polymetrix.featurizers.polymer import Polymer
psmiles = Polymer("[*]CC(C(OCC(C)C)=O)[*]")
polymer = Polymer.from_psmiles(psmiles)
```
The psmiles is parsed into an `RDKit` molecule and converted to a `NetworkX` graph (`_mol_to_nx`).

Step 2: Identify Connection Points
```python
from polymetrix.featurizers.polymer import get_connection_points
connection_points = polymer.get_connection_points()
print("Connection Points:", connection_points)
```
Output:
```
Connection Points: [0, 10]
```
The * atoms (nodes 0 and 10) are identified as connection points (`_identify_connection_points`).

Step 3: Find Shortest Paths
The `find_shortest_paths_between_stars` function computes the shortest path between nodes 0 and 10.
```python
from polymetrix.featurizers.polymer import find_shortest_paths_between_stars
paths = find_shortest_paths_between_stars(polymer.graph)
print("Shortest Paths:", paths)
```
```
Output:
Shortest Paths: [[0, 1, 2, 10]]
```
Step 4: Identify Cycles
The `find_cycles_including_paths` function identifies cycles that include the shortest paths found in the previous step.
```python
from polymetrix.featurizers.polymer import find_cycles_including_paths
cycles = find_cycles_including_paths(polymer.graph, paths)
print("Cycles:", cycles)
```
Output:
```
Cycles: []
```
Here, there are no cycles that include the shortest paths.

Step 5: Classify Backbone and Sidechains
The `classify_backbone_and_sidechains` function combines the paths and adds degree-1 nodes
```python
from polymetrix.featurizers.polymer import classify_backbone_and_sidechains
backbone, sidechains = classify_backbone_and_sidechains(polymer.graph, paths)
print("Backbone Nodes:", backbone)
print("Sidechain Nodes:", sidechains)
```
Output:
```
Backbone Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 10]
Sidechain Nodes: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
The backbone nodes are identified as nodes 0, 1, 2, and 10, while the side chain nodes are the remaining nodes.
